Create simple Pytest_ fixtures for writing integration tests based on Docker
containers. The framework provides a service class to start and stop containers
based Docker Compose. Each single container can be started individually.

Some parts of this package are taken from
https://github.com/AndreLouisCaron/pytest-docker


Usage with Pytest
=================

The docker compose file should contain all desired containers and the ports
should be exposed. In the following example we want to start the app to test
and a SQL database (Crate). Let's assume there is a ``Dockerfile`` for the app
in the same folder as the docker compose file::

    version: "3"
    services:
      app:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "8080"
        depends_on:
          - "crate"

      crate:
        image: crate:latest
        ports:
          - "4200"

In the ``conftest.py`` file we can declare the docker fixtures for each service
we want to be able to start in the tests::

    import pytest

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def docker_app(docker_services):
        docker_services.start('app')
        public_port = docker_services.wait_for_service("app", 8080)
        url = "http://{docker_services.docker_ip}:{public_port}".format(**locals())
        return url

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def docker_crate(docker_services):
        docker_services.start('crate')
        public_port = docker_services.wait_for_service("crate", 4200)
        dsn = "{docker_services.docker_ip}:{public_port}".format(**locals())
        return dsn

By default the fixture will look for the ``docker-compose.yml`` file in the
``tests`` subfolder of the path where ``pytest.ini`` resides (or the project's
root directory if no ini file is given - as in the tests example). In many
cases you will want to override the location for the docker compose files. Just
overwrite the ``docker_compose_files`` fixture in your ``conftest.py`` file::

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def docker_compose_files(pytestconfig):
        """Get the docker-compose.yml absolute path.
        Override this fixture in your tests if you need a custom location.
        """
        return [
            project_path('docker', 'docker-compose.yml'),
        ]

In your test file declare the fixtures you want to use::

    def test_something(docker_app, docker_crate):
        # e.g. initialize database
        ...
        # test something (e.g. request to docker_app)
        ...

A working configuration and test example can be found in the ``tests`` folder
of this package.


Execution in Docker Container
=============================

It's possible to execute a command inside one of the Docker containers. Use
the ``exec`` method of the ``docker_services`` fixture::

    def test_execute(docker_services):
        # the first argument is the service name of the compose file,
        # the following arguments build the command to run
        res = docker_services.execute('crate', 'ls', '-a')


Stopping a Docker Container
=============================

It's possible to stop single Docker containers. Use
the ``stop`` method of the ``docker_services`` fixture::

    def test_stop(docker_services):
        # the first argument is the service name of the compose file,
        # the following arguments build the command to run
        res = docker_services.stop('crate')


Wait for Service
================

The ``wait_for_service`` method of the service module checks whether the
docker service is really started. By default it makes a HTTP GET request to the
server's ``/`` endpoint. The service will retry to check until a timeout of
30 seconds has passed.

Custom Service Checker
----------------------

Some services may work differently and require a custom checker.

Create a custom service checker function which receives the IP address and the
port as parameters::

    def custom_service_checker(ip_address, port):
        # if service is ready
        return True
        # otherwise return False

In the fixture provide the custom service checker function as ``check_service``
parameter to the ``wait_for_service`` method::

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def docker_custom_service(docker_services):
        docker_services.start('custom_service')
        public_port = docker_services.wait_for_service(
            "app",
            8080,
            check_server=custom_service_checker
        )
        url = "http://{docker_services.docker_ip}:{public_port}".format(**locals())
        return url

To use another request path with the default checker the `url_checker` method
can be used to create a `check_url` method for another path::

    docker_services.wait_for_service(
        "app",
        8080,
        check_server=url_checker('/probe_status'),
    )


Run Tests
=========

Tests are held in the ``tests`` directory. Running tests is done via the
pytest package with::

    ./gradlew pytest
